## Hello Jekyll :wave:
This is my very first write up using **Jekyll**. After a long and careful search for a cool blogging platform, I stumbled upon this awesome theme by **Sergio Kopplin** named [Indigo](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo). Awesome part is that it's free :smiley:. A big thank you to [Sergio Kopplin](https://github.com/sergiokopplin) for this awesome work!
