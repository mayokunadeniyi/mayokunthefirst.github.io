## Hello Jekyll :wave:
<p align="center"><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"><img class="image" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/helloJekyll.png" alt="jekyll" style="width:80%"></a></p>

Welcome to my very first write up on this blog using **Jekyll**. I decided to move from the old and faithful [Medium](https://medium.com/@mayokunadeniyi) to this.

After a long and careful search for a cool blogging platform, I stumbled upon this awesome theme by **Sergio Kopplin** named [Indigo](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo). Awesome part is that it's free :smiley:. 
A big thank you to [Sergio Kopplin](https://github.com/sergiokopplin) for this awesome work!
